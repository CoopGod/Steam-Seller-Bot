# Steam Seller Bot
## ***What:***
The Steam Seller Bot is a **screen scapper** designed to sell items from your steam inventory quickly. The goal for this bot is to eliminate all the wasted time sorting through and **selling** hundreds of trading card, cases, or sprays. The bot quickly finds the starting price of the item that is being sold and lists your item at that price. The bot is also made in a way such that any passwords used to access Steam are not logged or acessed in any way, allowing the user to feel safe using the application bot.

## ***How to Use***
To be able to use this bot you must have [ChromeDriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) >= 97.0v

You must also have the latest version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) downloaded

After that:
1. Launch the python script via any CLI
2. Answer the prompt and submit the number of cards you are ready to sell
3. Once the chrome tab is opened and you are told to do so via the CLI, log into your steam account and navigate to the Inventory page
4. Sit back and let the bot work its magic!
